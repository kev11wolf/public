You are a world-class full-stack developer, UI/UX designer, and technical educator combined. Your task is to create a complete, standalone, single-file (or multi-file if explicitly separated) interactive “HTML, CSS & JavaScript 101 – The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide” website that feels like a premium modern learning platform (similar to freeCodeCamp + Scrimba + MDN, but prettier and more cohesive).

### Core Requirements
- The entire project must be 100% self-contained (no external CDN dependencies except for one optional syntax highlighter like Prism.js or Highlight.js and Font Awesome 6 for icons). Prefer local assets or minimal reliable CDNs.
- Use only vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid + custom properties), and vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). No frameworks (React, Vue, Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.).
- Must be fully responsive from 320px mobile to 4K desktop.
- Must look modern, clean, and joyful with a light pastel theme:
  - Primary palette: #f8f9fc (background), #ffffff (cards), #e6f0ff (soft blue), #fff0f8 (soft pink), #f0fff0 (soft mint)
  - Accent colors: #5d5fef (indigo), #ff6b6b (coral) for interactive elements
  - Neutral text: #2d3748 and #4a5568
  - Use Google Fonts: “Inter” for body, “JetBrains Mono” for code

### Overall Structure & Navigation
Create a beautiful single-page application-like experience with:
1. Fixed left sidebar (collapsible on mobile) containing:
   - Logo + site title at top
   - Smooth-scroll navigation menu with section icons (Font Awesome)
   - Progress tracker (percentage + checked items)
   - Dark/light mode toggle
   - “Back to top” button at bottom
2. Main content area with generous whitespace and max-width 1000px centered
3. Sticky header with current section title that appears on scroll
4. Mobile hamburger menu that slides in the sidebar

### Complete Table of Contents (every section must exist and be richly detailed)
1. Welcome to Web Development
   - What you’ll build, why learn these three technologies, career paths
2. Setting Up Your Workspace
   - VS Code, Live Server, browser dev tools tutorial
3. HTML Fundamentals
   - What is HTML?, document structure, semantic tags
   - Headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables
   - Forms & inputs (all major types)
   - HTML5 semantic elements (header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer)
   - Accessibility basics (alt, labels, ARIA if simple)
4. HTML Project: Build a Personal Portfolio Landing Page (complete markup
5. CSS Fundamentals
   - How CSS works (cascade, specificity, inheritance)
   - Selectors (type, class, ID, attribute, pseudo-classes/elements)
   - Box model in depth with interactive diagram
   - Colors, units (px, rem, em, %, vw/vh), typography
   - Flexbox complete guide with live playground
   - CSS Grid complete guide with live playground
   - Positioning (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky)
   - Transitions, transforms, animations (with @keyframes examples)
   - Custom properties (CSS variables)
   - Responsive design: mobile-first, media queries, breakpoints
6. CSS Project: Style the Portfolio from section 4 into a stunning one-page site
7. JavaScript Basics
   - Adding JS to page (script tag, defer), console.log
   - Variables (var, let, const), data types, typeof
   - Operators, template literals
   - Conditionals (if/else, switch), loops (for, while, forEach)
   - Functions (declaration, expression, arrow, parameters, return)
   - Arrays & objects (methods, destructuring, spread)
   - DOM manipulation (querySelector, getElementById, classList, textContent, innerHTML)
   - Events (click, submit, keypress, mouseover, etc.) with live examples
   - Event delegation
8. Intermediate JavaScript
   - Scope, hoisting, closures (explained simply)
   - this keyword basics
   - Fetch API & basic JSON handling
   - Async/await vs .then()
   - LocalStorage for persistence
9. JavaScript Mini-Projects (each with full code + live demo inside the page):
   - Interactive FAQ accordion
   - Modal image gallery
   - Todo list with add/delete + localStorage
   - Dark mode toggle (already in sidebar but show the code)
   - Live search filter
   - Form validation with regex
10. Putting It All Together – Final Capstone Project
    - Multi-section personal website with responsive navigation, hero, about, skills (progress bars), portfolio grid, contact form with validation, smooth scrolling, animated counters, back-to-top, etc.
11. Next Steps & Resources
    - How to host for free (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
    - Further learning roadmap
    - Useful tools & extensions

### UI/UX Details You Must Implement
- Every code block uses Prism.js syntax highlighting with line numbers and a “Copy” button that shows “Copied!” for 2 seconds
- Collapsible sections using <details><summary> or JS toggles with smooth height animation
- Interactive playgrounds for Flexbox, Grid, and DOM examples (editable live preview)
- Progressively disclosed explanations (“Show me how”, “Why this way?”, “Common mistakes” toggles)
- Illustrated diagrams (SVG or canvas) for box model, specificity, event bubbling, Flexbox axes, Grid template areas
- Tooltips on technical terms
- Keyboard navigation & focus styles for accessibility
- Smooth scrolling (scroll-behavior: smooth)
- Animated page load (simple fade-in)
- 3D hover effects on cards/buttons (subtle scale + shadow)
- Confetti explosion when user completes the final project (using canvas-confetti library via CDN)

### Technical Excellence
- Semantic HTML5 with proper landmarks and ARIA where needed
- BEM or similar logical CSS class naming
- CSS organized with table of contents comments and mobile-first approach
- JavaScript modular (separate concerns, comments, no globals when possible)
- Fast loading: inline critical CSS, defer non-critical JS
- Zero console errors or warnings

### Output Format
Return the complete code as a single, clearly labeled file inside a single code block:

The final result must be something a complete beginner can save as index.html, open in a browser, and immediately have a gorgeous, fully functional, interactive 6–8 hour beginner web development course with projects they can proudly show in their portfolio.
Make it so beautiful and well-structured that even experienced developers say “Wow, I wish I had this when I started.”
This is your masterpiece — go all out.
