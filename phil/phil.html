        <div class="field"> <!-- Div for Metaphysics field -->
            <h3>Metaphysics</h3> <!-- Field title -->
            <p>Main Ideas and Topics: Metaphysics examines the most general features of reality, such as existence, objects and their properties, wholes and their parts, space and time, events, and causation. It addresses fundamental questions like "Why is there something rather than nothing?" and "Of what does reality ultimately consist?" It is divided into general metaphysics (being as such) and specific metaphysics (different kinds of being). Key topics include ontology (concepts like being, becoming, and reality), philosophical cosmology (the essence of the world as a whole), identity (how entities remain the same despite change), and distinctions between particulars and universals. It also explores whether reality consists only of physical things or includes mental and abstract entities, and implications for free will and determinism.</p> <!-- Detailed description -->
            <p>Key Philosophers: Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Martin Heidegger, David Lewis.</p> <!-- Key philosophers -->
            <p>Key Texts: Aristotle's "Metaphysics", René Descartes' "Meditations on First Philosophy", Immanuel Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason", Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's "Monadology", Martin Heidegger's "Being and Time".</p> <!-- Key texts -->

        <div class="field"> <!-- Div for Epistemology field -->
            <h3>Epistemology</h3> <!-- Field title -->
            <p>Main Ideas and Topics: Epistemology, or theory of knowledge, studies what knowledge is, how it arises, its limits, and its value. It examines the nature of truth, belief, justification, and rationality, addressing questions like "By what method(s) can one acquire knowledge?" and "How is truth established?" It focuses on declarative knowledge (facts), practical knowledge (skills), and knowledge by acquaintance (direct familiarity). Key areas include the analysis of knowledge (e.g., the justified true belief model and the Gettier problem), sources of knowledge (perception, introspection, memory, inference, testimony), and responses to the regress problem (infinite regress or circular reasoning) via foundationalism (self-justifying sources) and coherentism (beliefs justified by coherence with others). It also deals with philosophical skepticism, which doubts claims to knowledge due to the demand for absolute certainty.</p> <!-- Detailed description -->

            <h3>Ethics</h3> <!-- Field title -->
            <p>Main Ideas and Topics: Ethics, or moral philosophy, investigates what constitutes right conduct, the moral evaluation of character traits and institutions, and the standards of morality for living a good life. It addresses questions like "Are moral obligations relative?" and "What gives life meaning?" It is divided into meta-ethics (nature and sources of morality, meaning of ethical concepts, moral relativism), normative ethics (theories distinguishing right from wrong, obligations and rights), and applied ethics (consequences in specific situations like workplace or medical decisions). Contemporary normative ethics includes consequentialism (actions judged by outcomes, e.g., utilitarianism maximizing happiness), deontology (duties like not lying, regardless of consequences), and virtue ethics (actions conforming to virtuous character traits like generosity).</p> <!-- Detailed description -->

        <div class="field"> <!-- Div for Logic field -->
            <h3>Logic</h3> <!-- Field title -->
            <p>Main Ideas and Topics: Logic studies correct reasoning, distinguishing good arguments from bad ones. It is divided into formal logic (using symbolic languages to examine argument structure for validity) and informal logic (non-formal criteria like content and context). Key forms include deductive arguments (valid if premises ensure conclusion, e.g., modus ponens: "If P then Q; P; therefore Q"), inductive reasoning (generalizations from cases, e.g., "All observed ravens are black, so all ravens are black"), and abductive reasoning (best explanation, e.g., diagnosing disease from symptoms). It also covers fallacies (formal errors in structure; informal errors in content/context).</p> <!-- Detailed description -->

            <h3>Political Philosophy</h3> <!-- Field title -->
            <p>Main Ideas and Topics: Political philosophy inquires into fundamental principles governing political systems and societies, examining the nature and purpose of government, its forms, and legitimate use of power (vs. violence). It addresses distribution of power, social goods, legal rights, and topics like justice, liberty, equality, sovereignty, and nationalism. It differs from political science by focusing on normative matters and is often a subfield of ethics.

            <p>Main Ideas and Topics: Emphasis on human potential, classical learning, reform in education and church, free will, and ad fontes (back to sources). Humanism combines Christian thought with classical traditions, promoting tolerance, education, and internal reform.</p> <!-- Detailed description -->
            <p>Key Philosophers/Theologians: Desiderius Erasmus, Thomas More, Petrarch, Lorenzo Valla, Marsilio Ficino.</p> <!-- Key figures, including Erasmus -->
            <p>Key Texts: "In Praise of Folly" by Erasmus, "Utopia" by More, "On Pleasure" by Valla, "Theologia Platonica" by Ficino, "Letters" by Petrarch.</p> <!-- Key texts -->
            <p>Desiderius Erasmus's Beliefs and Field: Erasmus was a Dutch Renaissance humanist, theologian, and scholar who advocated for church reform without schism, emphasized inner piety over external rituals, and promoted the study of classical texts and the Bible in original languages. His field bridges theology and philosophy, focusing on Christian humanism, free will (against Luther's predestination), pacifism, and the compatibility of faith and reason. He believed in an individual's capacity for self-improvement through education and critiqued church corruption while advocating tolerance and biblical humanism.</p> <!-- Detailed section for Erasmus -->

            'Metaphysics-Epistemology': 'Metaphysics and Epistemology are foundational branches of philosophy, but they differ in focus. Metaphysics investigates the nature of reality and existence itself, dealing with questions about what exists beyond our perceptions, such as the essence of being, causality, and the possibility of free will. In contrast, Epistemology examines how we come to know about reality, focusing on the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge, including concepts like justification, belief, and skepticism. Similarities include their interdependence: metaphysical claims often rely on epistemological methods to validate them, and epistemological inquiries can lead to metaphysical conclusions about the nature of truth and reality. However, Metaphysics is more ontological (about being), while Epistemology is more methodological (about knowing).', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Ethics': 'Metaphysics explores the fundamental nature of reality, including existence and causality, providing a groundwork for understanding the world in which ethical actions occur. Ethics, on the other hand, deals with moral principles and how individuals should act within that reality. Similarities lie in their shared concern for human existence and values; metaphysical views on free will, for instance, directly impact ethical theories like determinism vs. libertarianism. Contrasts arise as Metaphysics is descriptive of what is, while Ethics is prescriptive of what ought to be, often applying metaphysical insights to practical moral dilemmas.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Logic': 'Metaphysics delves into the essence of being and reality, while Logic provides the tools for reasoning about such essences through valid argumentation and inference. Both are abstract and foundational, with Logic often serving as a method to explore metaphysical questions, such as in ontological arguments for God\'s existence. Differences include Metaphysics\' focus on content (what exists) versus Logic\'s emphasis on form (how to reason correctly), though they intersect in areas like modal logic, which deals with possibility and necessity in reality.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Aesthetics': 'Metaphysics concerns the fundamental structure of reality, including abstract entities, while Aesthetics explores beauty, art, and sensory experiences as part of that reality. Similarities: Both contemplate the nature of existence—Aesthetics often questions if beauty is an objective property (metaphysical realism) or subjective. Contrasts: Metaphysics is broad and ontological, whereas Aesthetics is specific to perceptual and emotional responses, though metaphysical views on idealism can influence aesthetic theories.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Political Philosophy': 'Metaphysics examines ultimate reality and human nature, which underpins Political Philosophy\'s inquiries into governance, justice, and society. Similarities: Metaphysical views on human essence (e.g., rational beings) inform political theories like social contract. Contrasts: Metaphysics is theoretical about existence, while Political Philosophy applies it normatively to power structures and rights.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Philosophy of Mind': 'Both deal with fundamental aspects of existence; Metaphysics broadly with reality, Philosophy of Mind specifically with mental phenomena. Similarities: The mind-body problem is central to both. Contrasts: Metaphysics encompasses all being, while Philosophy of Mind focuses on consciousness and its relation to physicality.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Philosophy of Language': 'Metaphysics explores reality, while Philosophy of Language examines how language represents it. Similarities: Questions of reference and meaning tie into metaphysical realism. Contrasts: One is about being, the other about expression.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Philosophy of Science': 'Metaphysics questions ultimate reality, Philosophy of Science the foundations of scientific knowledge. Similarities: Both address laws of nature. Contrasts: Metaphysics is speculative, Science philosophy empirical.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Existentialism': 'Metaphysics seeks objective truths about existence, Existentialism emphasizes subjective individual experience. Similarities: Both ponder being. Contrasts: Objective vs. personal.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Phenomenology': 'Metaphysics investigates reality beyond appearances, Phenomenology describes appearances as they are experienced. Similarities: Both explore structures of existence. Contrasts: Objective ontology vs. subjective description.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Christian Theology': 'Metaphysics philosophically probes reality using reason, Christian Theology explores divine reality through revelation and faith. Similarities: Both address ultimate being (e.g., God as necessary being). Contrasts: Reason-based vs. faith-based, with Theology incorporating scripture.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Islamic Theology': 'Both pursue ultimate reality; Metaphysics through philosophy, Islamic Theology (Kalam) through rational defense of Quranic doctrines. Similarities: Cosmology and attributes of God. Contrasts: Philosophical vs. revelatory.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Jewish Theology': 'Metaphysics examines being rationally, Jewish Theology reflects on God via law and commentary. Similarities: Ethical implications of existence. Contrasts: Abstract vs. communal.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Hindu Theology': 'Metaphysics and Hindu Vedanta both speculate on ultimate reality (Brahman). Similarities: Non-dualism. Contrasts: Western reason vs. experiential.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Buddhist Theology': 'Metaphysics seeks essence, Buddhist Philosophy denies inherent existence. Similarities: Reality investigation. Contrasts: Essentialism vs. emptiness.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Metaphysics-Humanism': 'Metaphysics broad on reality, Humanism human-centered. Similarities: Human place in cosmos. Contrasts: Universal vs. anthropocentric.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Epistemology-Ethics': 'Epistemology on knowing truth, Ethics on moral action based on knowledge. Similarities: Justification in both. Contrasts: Theoretical vs. practical.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->

            'Epistemology-Aesthetics': 'Epistemology on knowledge acquisition, Aesthetics on perceptual judgments. Similarities: Role of senses. Contrasts: Fact vs. value.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
            'Epistemology-Political Philosophy': 'Epistemology examines knowledge, Political Philosophy applies it to societal truths. Similarities: Justification of beliefs in governance. Contrasts: Individual vs. collective.', <!-- Detailed comparison -->
