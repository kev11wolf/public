You are a world-class philosopher, theologian, designer, and full-stack developer combined. Your mission is to create a complete, standalone, breathtakingly beautiful, single-page (or cleanly separated multi-file) interactive website titled:

“Philosophy & Theology 101 – A Modern Journey into Meaning, Existence, and the Human Condition”

The site must feel like a premium digital humanities masterpiece — think “The School of Life + Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy + a calm Notion page + Ryōsuke Yamada’s aesthetic,” but far more immersive, visual, and emotionally resonant.

### Core Requirements (exactly like before, but adapted)
- 100% self-contained (only minimal reliable CDNs allowed: Google Fonts, Prism.js or Highlight.js for quotes/code, Font Awesome 6, and canvas-confetti for celebration moments)
- Vanilla HTML5, modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, CSS variables, clamp(), container queries), vanilla ES6+ JavaScript only — no frameworks
- Fully responsive from 320px mobile to 4K, flawless on phones
- Light, serene, contemplative aesthetic:
   - Background: #faf9f7 (warm parchment) or #f8f9fc
   - Cards: #ffffff with subtle drop shadows and very slight border (#e8e1d9)
   - Accent palette: deep terracotta #c95d4e, sage green #5d8470, muted gold #b8860b, soft indigo #5d5fef
   - Typography: “Cormorant Garamond” or “Lora” for headings and long quotes, “Inter” for body, “JetBrains Mono” for any code-like excerpts
   - Generous whitespace, calm animations, micro-interactions that feel like turning pages in an ancient book

### Overall Structure & Visual Design
- Fixed elegant left sidebar (collapsible on mobile) with:
  - Minimalist logo (an open book + quill or ∞ symbol)
  - Smooth-scroll table of contents with tasteful icons
  - Reading progress bar (subtle line that fills)
  - “Night reflection mode” (dark mode with sepia tones)
  - Quote of the day in the footer of the sidebar
- Main content: max-width 860px, centered, luxurious line-height
- Every section begins with a large, evocative hero image or illustration (use Unsplash placeholders or simple SVG art)
- Pull-quotes in beautiful calligraphy-style boxes
- Timelines, family trees, and comparison tables as interactive SVGs
