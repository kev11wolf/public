### **Detailed Summary of the HTML Cooking Schedule Web Application**

---

#### **Overview:**
This is a modern, visually appealing, responsive web application designed as a dynamic cooking schedule and recipe guide for a vacation trip spanning December 18 to December 28, 2025. It features an interactive weekly calendar, with days aligned to correct weekdays, and provides detailed step-by-step cooking instructions for each meal. The UI emphasizes sleekness, clarity, and user engagement, suitable for a production environment.

---

#### **Core Components:**

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - **Container Layout:**
     - Uses Bootstrap 5's container and grid system for responsiveness.
     - Contains a main title header displaying "California Vacation Cooking Schedule 2025."
   - **Weekday Header Row:**
     - A dedicated row displaying the days of the week (Sunday through Saturday) aligned with the upcoming dates.
   - **Calendar Grid:**
     - A CSS Grid layout with 7 columns, representing each day of the week.
     - Populated dynamically with day cards for each date in the trip interval.
   - **Instructions Panel:**
     - A styled card below the calendar, displaying detailed recipes and cooking instructions upon user interaction.
     - Initial placeholder prompting users to select a day.

2. **Styling (CSS):**
   - Uses a dark, modern theme with a gradient background.
   - Typography imports from Google Fonts ('Montserrat') for a sleek, contemporary font.
   - Calendar cards feature semi-transparent backgrounds, rounded corners, subtle hover effects, and shadowing for depth.
   - Responsive design ensures usability on mobile devices by adjusting grid layout for smaller screens.

3. **JavaScript Logic:**
   - **Date Calculation:**
     - Starts from December 18, 2025, and calculates the start date for the calendar grid by moving back to the previous Sunday to align the week header correctly.
     - Creates an array of Date objects covering 11 days (Dec 18 to Dec 28 inclusive).
   - **Week Header Population:**
     - Dynamically creates a static header row listing the days of the week in the correct order.
   - **Calendar Population:**
     - Iterates over the date array.
     - For each date:
       - Determines the weekday name (Sunday to Saturday).
       - Formats the date as "M/D."
       - Assigns a meal name based on the date:
         - The special meal "Smoked Brisket" explicitly assigned to December 25, 2025 (Wednesday, Christmas Day).
         - Other days default to placeholder or sequential recipes.
       - Creates a card element with:
         - Weekday name,
         - Date,
         - Meal name (or placeholder).
       - Adds click event listeners to each card that trigger the display of detailed instructions.
   - **Instruction Display Function (`displayInstructions`):**
     - When a card is clicked:
       - Retrieves the meal's recipe details from a predefined object.
       - Injects detailed, formatted HTML into the instructions panel, including:
         - Meal name,
         - Ingredient list,
         - Step-by-step cooking instructions with emphasis on:
           - Maintaining steady smoker temperatures at 225°F for pork and brisket.
           - Tips to avoid the stall (around 150-170°F), with wrapping advice.
           - Internal temperature targets for optimal tenderness (195-205°F for pork, 195-203°F for brisket).
           - Wood pairing recommendations:
             - Applewood or hickory for pork and brisket.
             - Oak or hickory for steak and chicken.
             - Fruit woods (apple, cherry) for sausages.
         - Detailed step instructions with emphasis on temperature control, wrapping at stall, resting periods, and slicing.
     - If no recipe is assigned or placeholder, displays a generic message.
